## TODO

### Stage 1: Basic Web Analytics
- [ ] **Develop a Tracking Script**
  - Create a JavaScript script for basic tracking (page views, session times, unique visitor ID).
  - Ensure easy embeddability into web pages.

- [ ] **Set Up a Backend to Receive Data**
  - Develop a backend (Node.js, Python, etc.) to receive and store data.
  - Choose and set up a database with a simple schema.

- [ ] **Basic Reporting Interface**
  - Create a basic web interface for displaying total page views and unique visitors.
  - Implement simple charts or tables for data display.

- [ ] **Deployment and Testing**
  - Deploy the application on a cloud server or locally.
  - Test the tracking to reporting flow.

### Stage 2: Enhanced Data Collection and Reporting
- [ ] **Enhance the Tracking Script**
  - Add data collection for referral source, browser/device info, and page time.

- [ ] **Update Backend and Database**
  - Adapt the backend for additional data processing.
  - Update the database schema as needed.

- [ ] **Improved Reporting Interface**

  - Use a framework (Apache Spark, Node.js) for real-time data processing.

- [ ] **Real-Time Dashboard**
  - Develop a real-time dashboard in the web interface.
  - Display metrics like active users and page views per minute.

- [ ] **Testing Real-Time Features**
  - Test real-time data processing and dashboard updates.
  - Ensure efficient handling of data streams.

### Stage 4: Full-Fledged Real-Time Analytics
- [ ] **Advanced Real-Time Analytics**
  - Enhance real-time processing (user flow, session tracking, event triggers).
  - Implement real-time alerts for specific conditions.

- [ ] **Scalability and Robustness**
  - Ensure system scalability for higher loads.
  - Implement robust error handling and data recovery.

- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing and Optimization**
  - Conduct extensive testing (load, stress).
  - Optimize for performance and reliability.

### Final Steps
- [ ] **Documentation**
  - Document features, setup, and usage of the tool.

- [ ] **User Feedback**
  - Gather feedback from users and iterate based on it.

- [ ] **Continuous Improvement**
  - Continuously improve the tool with new features and updates.
